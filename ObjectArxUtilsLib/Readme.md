ObjectArxUtilsLib
=================

This project is a C++ static library for some operations of CAD,like draw text,draw circle,draw line...and so on.  

I'm a beginner of work for secondary development of CAD,it's so much function in objectArx,so I want to create utils,at last,I found this project: [lysjq/AutoCAD-ObjectArx](https://github.com/lysjq/AutoCAD-ObjectArx).

It's a good util for ObjectArx,however,not enough to me.And I add some additional functions.

Maybe I will continue to maintain this project in the funture ^-^

Notice
------

This project is only for ObjectARX2021,so it only supports 64bit(Autodesk abandoned the 32-bit library in ObjectArx2021).
